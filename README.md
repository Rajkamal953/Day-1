# Day-1 Task

1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Ans:
   HTTP1.1 Loads a Single Request For Every Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) Connection.
   HTTP2 Avoids Network Delay By Using Multiplexing.
   HTTP1.1 Provides Faster Delivery Of Web Pages And Reduces Web Traffic As Compared To HTTP1.0.
   HTTP2 Utilizes Multiplexing And Server Push To Effectively Reduce The Page Load Time By a Greater Margin Along With Being Less Sensitive to Network Delays.
   
 2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
 
 Ans:
   Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes like number, string, boolean,null,undefined and symbol.
   Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key.
   These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
   primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
